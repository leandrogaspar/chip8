[Play with it!](https://leandrogaspar.github.io/chip8/)

## The ever-growing non-exhaustive over-hyphenated to-do list
- [ ] Fix scroll-bar on Firefox
- [ ] Fix select rom style
- [ ] Keypad should show the keyboward mapping
- [ ] Test more ROM's
- [ ] Make the emulator color configurable

## Development

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
The interpreter will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

Each test compares the Chip-8 state after an instruction against an expected state. This approach was chosen because we want to be sure that an instruction only alter the involved properties.<br>
For instance, a instruction that perform a jump should only change the PC - any other change would be a bug.

A typical test looks like this:

```code
...

chip8 = createChip8(); // Create a chip-8 instance
writeWord(chip8, 0x200, 0x1EEE); // Load an instruction
const snapshot = chip8Snapshot(chip8); // Create a copy of the current state

// Change the copy to reflect our expected state for the instruction
snapshot.PC = 0xEEE;

// Perform the instruction
chip8.cycle();

// Compares the state of the actual chip-8 after
// the instruction vs our expectation.
// If the instruction wrongly changed V[0], for example,
// the test would fail warning that the register doesn't match
const equals = isChip8Equal(chip8, snapshot);
expect(equals).toBe(true);

...
```

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
